Description:

Sin Leria is 2D Tower Defense inspired by Plant Vs Zombie. The player enters the world of Sin'Leria, a northern human kingdom known for its enchanted lands and it's ice magic.
Sin'Leria is getting attacked by the White Walkers army, it will be the role of the player to eliminate the consecutive White Walkers waves using its army strategically like a king would do to defend his realm.
The army of the kingdom is mainly composed of ice mages but the player will cooperate with the realm of Flein that will send their witches who use dark magic to defend their lands. 

At the beginning of each level, the king subordinates will tell the player what's going on in the current level, if the scout spotted a new type of enemy incoming, how to use the newly unlocked unit, adding an immersive touch to the game.

Making this game allowed me to work on different gameplay mechanics such as attacker spawning, cooldowns, defender placing in world space, strategic resources management, and score handling.

Gameplay:

The player summons his units on the board, by first selecting the desired unit to invoke through the unit panel, and place it into the world by clicking on the desired place. Depending on each unit, the player will need to spend a certain amount of star that can be gained using the star trophy (non-offensive unit). Finally, the player will simply need to place his army and spend stars strategically, depending on the kind of enemies the waves are composed of.

The game pace is slowed down at the start of each level, letting the player the time to read the subordinate's indications (tutorial). The normal pace is back when the player clicks somewhere in the world.

Type of allies:
1. Ice Mage: the first unit the player gets, mages attack at a fast pace but are weak. The player will need to combine their forces to be really useful. 
2. Dark Witches: dark magic is more powerful and deals a lot of damage but the witches need a certain amount of time to cast their spell. They are also quite easy to kill.
3. Blocking Stone: This defensive unit can be used on a lane to block enemies, letting the time for mages and witches to attack. This unit is tanky and harder to get rid of for the enemies.
4. Star Trophy: this unit is non-offensive. It makes the player gain stars, the currency in the game. The more trophies there are, the faster the player will gain stars but this unit occupies a slot in world space that could be used by an offensive unit instead.

Type of enemies:
1. The Walkers: they are the basic enemies, they move fast and are the easiest enemy unit to kill. 
2. The Knights: they are the enemy leaders, deal heavy damages, are quite tanky and can jump over blocking stones.
3. The ice Golems: they deal serious damages but move at a slow pace. Although they are really difficult to kill, the blocking stone can play a major role against them.
