# Sin-Leria

Description:

Sin Leria is 2D Tower Defense inspired by Plant Vs Zombie. The player is teleported in the world of Sin'Leria, a northern human kingdom known for its enchanted lands and it's ice magic.
Sin'Leria is getting attacked by the White Walkers army, it will be the role of the player to eliminate the consecutive White Walkers waves using its army strategically like a king would do to defend his realm.
The army of the kingdom is composed of ice mage but the player will cooperate with the realm of Flein that will send their witches using dark magic to defend their lands. 

At the beginning of each level, the king subordinates will tell the player what's going on in the current level, if the scout spotted a new type of enemy incoming, how to use the newly unlocked unit, adding an immersive touch to the game.

Making this game allowed me to work on different gameplay mechanics such as attacker spawning, cooldowns, defender placing in world space, strategic ressources management, and score handling.

Gameplay:

At the beginning of each level, the game is slowed down letting the player read the subordinate indications (tutorial). The normal pace is back when the player click somewhere in the world.

Type of allies:
1. Ice Mage: first unit the player get, the mages attack at a fast pace but are weak. The need to combine their forces to be really useful. 
2. Dark Witches: dark magic is more powerful and deal a lot of damage but the witches need a certain amout of time to cast their spell. They are also quite easy to kill.
3. Blocking Stone: This defensive unit can be used on a lane to block enemies, letting the time for the mages and witches to deal damages. This unit is tanky and harder to get rid of for the enemies.
4. Star Trophee: this unit is non-offensive. It makes the player gain more star being the currency in the game. The more trophee their is, the faster player will get stars but this unit occupy a slot in world space that could be used by an offensive unit instead.

Type of enemies:
1. The Walkers: they the basic enemies, they move fast and are the easiest to kill. 
2. The Knights: they are the enemy leader, deal heavy damages, are quite tanky and can jump over blocking stones.
3. The ice Golems: this unit deals serious damages but is quit slow. Although they are really difficult to kill, the blocking stone can play a crucial role against them.
